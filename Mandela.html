            <p class="lessons">Nelson Mandela was a global symbol of resistance against apartheid in South Africa.
                 A key figure in the anti-apartheid movement, Mandela's commitment to justice led to his imprisonment for 27 years. 
                 Upon his release in 1990, he played a pivotal role in ending apartheid and became South Africa's first black president in 1994.
                  Mandela's presidency focused on reconciliation and building a united nation. 
                  His enduring legacy lies in his emphasis on forgiveness and inclusivity, leaving the world with a powerful message:
                   <strong>"It always seems impossible until it's done."</strong> 
                   Mandela died but his legacy lives on as an inspiration for resilience and courage.</p>
